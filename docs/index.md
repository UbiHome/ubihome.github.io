# Welcome to OSHome!

OSHome is a single executable that allows you to integrate any device running an OS into your smart home. 
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use - similar to ESPHome.

- Execute a command on a device based on a trigger in home assistant. 
- Monitor the status of a device with a custom command. 
- Integrate all of your _one off python scripts^TM^_ without thinking about connectivity or setting up yet another service.

See the [getting started](getting_started/index.md) guide for installation instructions.

Explore the [examples](examples/index.md) to see how to use OSHome.
