        curl -L -o oshome.tar.gz https://github.com/DanielHabenicht/OSHome/releases/download/v0.4.7/oshome-Linux-musleabi-armv7.tar.gz
        tar xvzf ./oshome.tar.gz
        ```

    2. Edit the configuration file `config.yaml` in the same directory as the executable. It could contain the following:

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "getting_started/linux.yml"
        ```

    3.  Try it out:

        ``` bash
        ./oshome run
        OSHome - 0.4.7
        LogDirectory: /home/codespace/.local/share
        Config file path: /workspaces/OSHome/config.yaml
        Binary Sensor 'bluetooth_connected' output: false
        Sensor 'ram_usage' output: 38.3144
        Button 'my_button' pressed.
        Command executed successfully with no output.
        # End the process with ctrl+c
        ```

    4.  You should be able to see your device in Home Assistant now.

    5.  To persistently run the executable install it as a service:

        ``` bash
        sudo ./oshome install
        # The CLI will ask you where to install it. (You can just hit enter to install it in the default location)
        ? Where do you want to install OSHome? (/usr/bin/oshome)
        ```

        > If you do this more often you can add the --install-path flag to the command to specify the path for the installation. Instead of the CLI asking for it.
