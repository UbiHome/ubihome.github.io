    4.  You should be able to see your device in Home Assistant now.

    5.  To persistently run the executable install it as a service:

        ``` bash
        sudo ./ubihome install

        ? Where do you want to install UbiHome? (/usr/bin/ubihome)
        ```

        > If you do this more often you can add the --install-path flag to the command to specify the path for the installation. Instead of the CLI asking for it.
